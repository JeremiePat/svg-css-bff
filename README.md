Hi!

Let me tel you a story.
Once upon a time…

They were a tiny, lonely, pointy SVG square.
Nobody really liked it and it felt miserable.

Fortunately it had a good friend CSS to cheer it up.

And SVG taught CSS many magic tricks.

Yes, friendship is magic.
Oh! Wait! This is not one single square you could said.

Well, it is! It's just that it is reUSEd quite extensively.

But that does not fool CSS that can use it's own powers to punch through that mist.

And it becomes even better when they decide to combine their powers.
Here comes our hero.
At that point we can go crazy, and turn our single square into anything…

like… flowers!

Or… a teapot!
Everything is possible with just one square.

At that point we venture a bright world of awesomeness.

But hidden in the shadow… here come our vilain.
Oh yes! It really doesn't like SVG.
It wishes to have CSS only playing with HTML.

So it sends us one of its minions… A nasty bug.
But let me show you the true face of evil!

Here! Look! That single line!
It looks so simple, so gentle, so innocent!
Don't be fooled. That line alone not just lie about transition.
It also wiped out the whole rendering of our use elements
Dismissed plain and simple in a Blink of a transition.

That bug. THAT BUG, my friends!
It broke my heart.

So the time as come for you, my friends, to stand up.
By using CSS
And SVG together
You will make the awesomeness to shine again
You will be the messenger to the world that
CSS and SVG are best friends forever!
Thank you, you're awesome.
